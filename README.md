## Description

Password generator, version 2. The first version is [here](https://github.com/Zalexanninev15/PassGen)

## Features

- Flexible system of password generator settings (you can customize the password length and configure groups of characters that can be included in the password.)
- Nice and easy to use UI with some animations (unlike the first version, there are no problems with displaying elements in different browsers). *For some reason, the "rage" (aka scrollbar) in Firefox is dark blue, which is not quite correct, please tell me how to solve this problem (the desired color is #3B75BA), screenshot soon*
